Data Sheet for Mission Impact Data
==================================

The description of required and recommended fields for Mission Impact data follows.

**Note**: DO NOT edit this file directly. This file was generated from ```etl/schemas/mission_impact_table_schema.json```.<br>To edit this file, make changes to ```etl/schemas/mission_impact_table_schema.json``` and run (from the repo root) ```python -m scripts.generate_datasheets mi``` to re-generate this file.

To derive the column-based name/key from the API Key listed here, the default is to add the milestone flag as a prefix (i.e. `IntakeDate`, `ExitDate`, `NinetyDaysDate`). However, some fields do not use this naming convention (i.e. `IntakeCurrentMostRecentJobLastDayOfWork` and `ExitJobPlacementStartDate` for `JobDate`). For fields that differ from the default naming convention, the names are listed in the `Custom Milestone Names` column of this datasheet.

If your mouse does not allow horizontal scroll, click on the table and use the left/right arrow keys to view all columns.
